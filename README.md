## Overview

This project is a Linktree clone developed for me to explore the features of Supabase, a powerful open-source Firebase alternative. With this Linktree Clone, you can create a page with links, similar to linktr.ee website. It provides features for both creators and users to manage and access links easily.

## Features
- ✅ Authentication system (Login and Sign Up)
- ✅ View other creator's page
- ✅ Add/Delete links
- ✅ Change profile pictures

⚠️ Warning: Please use a throwaway email and password for testing purposes, as the app's security is not guaranteed.
